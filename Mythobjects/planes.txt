# Planes can be any type of physical realm in which beings recide in. Only primordial forces and deities can exist outside of an plane.
# Planes have a number of traits that define how they work. This in turn determines who lives there and who can exert what power.
# Plane:
# 		Creator: The creator is either a primordial force or a deity. 
#		Neighbours: Determines what planes are connected to each other. It is not possible to travel between two unconnected planes.
#       Types: Material, Ethereal, Elemental. These types are broad definitions of any world.

## The size of a plane determines with how many other planes it can connect and how much space there is inside of it.
# inifinite: Can connect to any number of planes.
# large: can connect with up to 16 planes
# medium: can connect with up to 8 planes
# small: can connect with up to 4 planes
# pocket: can only connect to a single plane.
