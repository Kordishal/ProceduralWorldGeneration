## A species is a collection of beings with similar traits and a common evolutionary or creationist predecessor. 
# A new species can either be created by primordial forces or a deity.
# Many species have the ability to evolve into a new (higher) species.
# Possible species are: humans, dwarfs, elves, mammals, reptilians, molluscoids, single cell organisms, multi cell organism, fish, dragons etc.
# species which are not sentient can become so through evolution or outside influence
# sentient species can become sapient either through evolution or through outside influence
# Sapients species are as well able to form civilisations.
#
# Traits: Every species can have a number of traits. What traits a species has heavily influences the actions of the species.
